#Welcome to Ruby!!

This is a four-week course where you will use a combination of [Codecademy.com](https://codecademy.com) (Learning environment) & [Cloud 9](https://c9.io) to learn how some basics of the Ruby language, how to write a Rock, Paper, Scissers game with what you've learned and ultimately how to keep learning to program beyond the limits of this class. 

I am Mr. Margolis. IF you have any questions, please email me at [meetjosephmargolis@gmail.com](mailto:meetjosephmargolis@gmail.com).

This repository will be your online record of our work together. Look for regular updates of our programming work together in class each week.
